            <h1>Aviation</h1>
            <h2>The Beginnings</h2>
            <p>Since a young age, I was very lucky to be able to sit in many different commercial airplanes. 
                I would always check in early to choose the window seat, as I would be intrigued of the moving surfaces on the wing. 
            However, when I joined the cadet program with my elementry school friends, I wouldn't have known that I would be able to receive my wings through the program. 
        In my level three/four year of the program, we were taught basic ground school (aviation lessons), as my excitement and passion for aviation began to grow rapidly. 
    At the same time as this, I was looking at the uniforms of the senior cadets, when badges shaped like the wings stood out to me. 
Later did I know, these wings were awarded to cadets who completed the glider and power pilot training course - the greatest challenge for any air cadet to undergo.</p>

            <h2>Glider Pilot Training Course</h2>
            <p>
                At around 15 years old, I registered for the Moncton Flight College asynchronous ground school, the very first step of my Glider Pilot Training Course (GPTC) experience. 
                Through Oct-Jan 2022, I dedicated 140+ hours into understanding Airframes, Systems, Theory of Flight, Meteorology, Flight Operations, Human Factors, Air Laws, Navigation and Radio Theory. 
                With the large commitment, I was able to acheive a 98% on the final exam, scoring the highest mark in my whole squadron. 
                After the ground school came the interviews - the interveiwers consisting of various Department of National Defense and Ontario Provincial Comitee Board Membeers - these two parties fund both GPTC and PPTC.
                It was such a shock when I received my acceptance email stating that I was one of the 30 out of 17,000 cadets in the central Canada region, representing the air cadets to take part of the GPTC.

                The GPTC is a seven weeks long, intensive course, consisting of 15 hours of ground school, and six hours of flight time, with 20 takeoffs and landings. 
                This course was held in Trenton Cadet Training Center, beside Canadian Forces Base Trenton, one of the largest military bases all over Canada. 
                This course presented many challenges. Firstly, I was away from home for 20 times longer than my previous experiences, and this was my first cadet summer training course experience - living in a military base for the first time. 
                However, I embraced the challenge: my classmates that I have just met for a day became my best companions for the seven weeks.

                Flying gliders requires a large amount of spatial awareness and multitasking. 
                As gliders do not have an engine, the pilot must confidently judge how far they can be from a landing field, at a certain altitude. 
                This skill is known as flight management. 
                Flight management is especially crucial when a glider begins their approach on landing, as they must preform certain maneuvers to meet predetermined altitudes in the circuit patterm, to ensure that the glider will land at the ideal landing spot. 
                While maintaining flight management, a glider pilot must also make their position radio calls, maintain a specified speed, and preform other manuevers (e.g. turns), which require the skill of multitasking.
                Through these seven weeks, I have developed a greater spatial awareness due to flight management, and have improved my multitasking skills.
                Because of this, I received my glider wings at the end of the 2023 summer. 
                Additionally, I was awarded with the 8 Wing Trenton Commanding Officer's Coin for my hard work and dedication through the seven weeks.

                After completing the GPTC, I have planned to give back to the program by volunteering at local cadet flying sites, Markham and Borden CFS, enabling the newer cadets to expereince flying in a glider. 
                Every few weekends, I dedicate my time to inspect gliders in the morning, give glider tours, preform safety breifings, help out with the ground crew, and also cleaning the site at the end of the day.
