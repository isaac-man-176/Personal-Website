            <h2>First Robotics Competition</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout highschool, I have been one of the founders of the First Robotics Competition team. 
                With dedication and commitment, I became a lead in the design team, and have helped out in the manufacturing and electrical team. 
                As a design team lead, I teach 20+ highschool students from sketching and assembling the various parts together in CAD softwares, all the way to making a functional and efficient robot. 
                During the build season, I delegate work to other design team members and I am responsible for ensuring that the design of the robot is completed by a set date.
                The design leads communicate with the leads of the various other subteams to ensure that the robot can be finished in a tight timespan.

                What is FRC? 
                The 
                <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">First Robotics Competition</a>
                , or FRC for short, is an international robotics competition where high school teams design, build and program a robot to compete in a themed game. 
                Throughout the build-season, teams develop skills across various fields including: computer aided design (CAD) software, computerized numerical control (CNC) machines, 3D printers, programming, electronics control system design, business development and problem-solving.
                FRC teams partake in outreach events, such as going to local schools and neighbourhooods, to share the passion of STEM in the community.

                What skills have I aquired in robotics? 
                I am very experienced in many CAD softwares including Onshape and Fusion 360. 
                Throughout the four years of robotics, I have been designing various robotics subsystems, such as the intake and the shooter. 
                Furthermore, I have also used Mastercam, CNC machines, 3D printers such as Ultimaker, and laser cutters such as Glowforge to create various parts for the robot.

                Our Robotics Team
                <a href="https://www.knightowls.ca/">8884 Knight Owls</a>
                 was founded by several Northern Secondary School students in 2021, and continues to grow after every year, with almost 80 new joiners at the beginning of the school year. 
                The Knight Owls has won various awards, including the Innovation in Control Award, Industrial Design Award sponsored by General Motors, Highest Rookie Seed and the Rookie Inspiration Award.
                Throughout the past years, our success in the regional events has enabled us to compete in the provincial competition.
